Fonebone and Kaputnik were arrested the other day, for posing illegally as doctors.<p>

Police stated that anyone who had been attended by either person should quickly see a REAL doctor.  This doctor will then determin whether or not a person is actually sick.<p>

For more information, see the <a href="http://www.madmag.com">Mad Magazine Website</a><p>

<b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: this is a different Fonebone and Kaptunik than the other story. There's a rather large problem here.<p>

<i>RETRACTION</i>: This story does not involve a third Fonebone and Kaputnik. We apologize for the confusion.<p>
