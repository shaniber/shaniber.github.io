				This is the <i>Better Balls</i> project.  It is my first project
				that I actually feel is worthwhile to put up a major 
				explanation page.
				</p>

				<p align=justify>
				Better Balls is, I think, a natural step that every games 
				programmer takes when first starting out... they make circles, 
				and then try to bounce them off of each other.  My friend 
				(who works at a large game company), said that a lot of 
				programmers looked at the program running on his screen at
				work with a whistful look in their eye.

				<p align=justify>
				While I was working on this, I used 
				<a href="http://www.canvasnet.com/gfoot/vivace/" target=new>
				George Foot's Allegro Vivace Tutorial</a>.  In particular, I 
				used his basic setup for a 'game', and his code for circles.
				(see chapter 4 in the tutorial).  I figured that that 
				part was the simplest part, since I'd already drawn primitive
				shapes and made them move.
				</p>

				<p align=justify>
				The circles are all pseudo-randonly generated: their x,y
				coordinates, their velocity vector, their colour and their
				radius are all genereated using rand().  However, there is 
				code in place that determines if the circles are generated
				over top of each other.  (See collisions.c).  I was able to
				reuse the same code to detect collisions.
				</p>
				
				<p align=justify>
				Problems with this current build:  the physics is <b>hacky</b>.
				To make them bounce, all I do is switch velocity vectors 
				between circles.  As well, circles will get stuck together, 
				and will disappear off of the screen.  I'm working on a 
				trick or two to fix this.
				<p>

				<p align=justify>
				To download, <a href=".">click here</a>.  This will give you 
				the directory listing.  I'll write up something better 
				soon, so that you can download these directly from this page.
