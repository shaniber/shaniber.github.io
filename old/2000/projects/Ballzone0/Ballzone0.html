				This is Ballzone 0, my latest effort.  It's a happy little
				toy where you control a ball that bounces around!  The 
				laffs abound as you try and bounce your little red ball off
				of the evil blue ball.
				</p>

				<p align=justify>
				This little project is an evolution of 
				<a href="../BetterBalls2/BetterBalls2.html">Better Balls 2</a>.
				It takes the code developed there for fancy-schmancy 
				bouncing balls and adds the all-important user input with 
				something other than the keyboard.

				</p>
				
				<p align=justify>
				This project is a recreation of an assignment from my
				university graphics class.  I had a better metaphor for 
				control of the ball then, but I'm tired of working on 
				it now, so I decided that what I've got is acceptable.
				</p>

				<p align=justify>
				When you first start bz0, you'll find a blue, bouncing 
				ball, and a motionless Red ball.  If you right click, the 
				Red ball will appear under your mouse pointer.  If you hold
				the right mouse button, the ball with be stuck to it until
				you release it.  The ball will stop where the right mouse
				button is released.
				</p>

				<p align=justify>
				The left mouse button is where the fun is.  If you click the 
				left mouse button, the Red ball will appear under the 
				pointer.  If you hold the left mouse button, the Red ball
				will be stuck to the pointer, until you release the
				button.  When the left mouse button is released, the ball
				goes flying off in the same direction you were moving, 
				at the same speed.  Fun!
				<p>

				<p align=justify>
				Problems with this version:  There's only a couple of 
				bugs/problems with this version.  First, the balls 
				will occasionally disappear from the screen.  If the red
				ball leaves, just click one of the mouse buttons, and 
				it will reappear under the mouse pointer.  If the Blue 
				ball disappears, then press the space button, and it will 
				appear in the upper left side of the screen.
				</p>
				
				<p align=justify>
				The other big problem with the program is that I don't know
				HOW or WHY the code for the ball launching works.  I was 
				just hacking around, trying different things, and this
				happened to work well, so I decided to stick with it.  I'm 
				sure that I'll eventually figure it out, so I'm not too
				worried about it.
				</p>

				<p align=justify>
				Oh yeah... the balls will also occasionally get stuck within
				each other.  Again, I think it looks kinda cool, so I 
				left it in.  I'm not concerned with perfection right now!
