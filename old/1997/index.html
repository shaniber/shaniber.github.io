<font face=arial,helvetica size=+1>Hello, and welcome to my little 
contribution to the clutter on the 'WWW'.  
I'll try to keep this down to size, without alot of big-ass graphics, and 
stuff like that.  I don't believe in those sort of things, as they just 
take away from the content of the 'page'<p>
Wait a minute... WHAT content?

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
I'm a student at the 
<A HREF="http://www.usask.ca/index.html"> University of Saskatchewan</A>  
in the 
<A HREF="http://arts.usask.ca/"> College of Arts and Sciences.</A>
I'm a <A HREF="http://www.cs.usask.ca/">Computer Science</A> major, with
a secondary discipline in Psycholgy.  Can we say
"Artificial Intelligence"?  Actually, what I wanna do is make games.  I  
figure if the guys at <A HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com">id software</A> 
can do it, why I? 
<p>
Since you're so interested in what I'm doing with my life, why don't you 
check out my <A HREF="resume.html">resume</A>.  Perhaps you'll find me a 
neato job!
<p>
Since I'm going to University, I need someplace to live.  I used to be a 
Residence 
Assitant at the <A HREF="rezindex.html">Voyageur Place Residence 
Association</A>, but the stress of living in Rez was getting to me, so now i'm living in
the University Highrises.  (Run by the same people)  Since I haven't seen ANYTHING 
that even remotely resembles a Rez homepage, I've taken it upon myself to design one.
However, I've heard rumors that the admin is actually getting off their duff and making use 
of this big ole WWW, so as soon as I find out the URL, it's HERE!

<h2> Computer Classes </h2>

the pages are simple, and to the point, and pretty indicative of my views 
on WWW design.<br>

<h3><a href="371/index.html">CMPT 371</a></h3>
