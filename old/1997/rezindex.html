This is the <em>V.P.R.A.</em>!
</h1>

Located on the beautiful 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.usask.ca/tourist/campusmap.html">campus</A> of 
the <A HREF="http://www.usask.ca">U of S</A>, is the Voyaguer 
Place Residence Association.  It consists of <A HREF="#halls">4 halls</A> 
in which the students are housed.  The halls house approximately 600 students, 
both male and female, separated into men's and women's dorms.  However, the 
<A HREF ="#bosses">management</A> recently began a test period in which a 
few women are being roomed on the top floor of one of the men's halls. 
The <A HREF="#ra">Residence Assistants</A> are hired by the Management 
to help keep the rules, and are hired from the students themselves. <p>

<A NAME="bosses">The Management</A><br>
Several people are needed to help the Residence run smoothly.  They include:
<dl>
<dt>Neil Nickel, Residence Manager
<dd>This man is the main policy invoker of the residence.  He directs the 
other residence managers in their day-to-day business.  He also has a 
great head of hair.  
<dt>Gord Snell, Assistant Manager - Facilities
<dd>Gord is in charge of physical plant (ie, maintenance) for the 
Residence.  He makes sure that all is well with the rooms, and that 
nothing is falling apart.  Watch for his mustache come winter.
<dt>Sylvia Cholodnuik, Assistant Manager - Student Life
<dd>Sylvia is the person who is in direct contact with the students on a 
daily basis.  She is the one that puts up with all the whining and 
complaining about everything.  She also takes care of final discipline, 
after the Residence Assitants have done their job... but she's a nice 
person.  Really!  
<dt>John Olson, ????
<dd>He's got an office here, and I think that he's the "Big Guy" of 
Rez... but we're not sure.  All I know is that he is around, and VEWY 
MYSTEWIOS.  
<dt>Other VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE.
<dd>There is a host of Secretaries, Cartakers, and Maintenance People, 
without whom Rez would not run.  They are the people that wander around 
and actually take care of the bookkeeping and upkeep of the rez.  Without 
them, the Managers would be Lost.  
</dl>

<p>
<A NAME="ra">The Residence Assistants (RAs)</A><br>
These are Students who have lived in the Residence for a short while, and 
have a reasonable knowledge of the Residence's layout and rules.  They 
are NOT hired as Policemen or Babysitters, contrary to popular belief.  
Instead, they are hired as Diplomats and Emmisaries between the Residence 
Management and the Students.  While the are required to maintain the 
rules, they are also available to assist with any Academic, Residence, or 
Personal relatied problem.  They aren't Trained Counsellors, but they 
can find one for any requirement if it's needed.<p>

<p>
<A NAME="halls">The Residence Halls</A><br>
There are 4 halls in the VPRA complex.  These include:
<dt>Saskatchewan Hall
<dd>This is one of the original halls in the residence complex.  It now houses one third
of the male population of rez.  The nickname of this hall is &quot; Hearne &quot;, and the men living
there are the &quot; Heathens &quot;.  <br>
<dd>Recently, the administration decided to try a co-ed dorm, and Sask Hall was picked.  Half of the third 
floor was given to upper year females who were interested.
<dt>Qu'Appelle Hall
<dd>This is the second of the original halls of the VPRA.  It also houses a third of the men, and
is generally considered to have the largest, most comfortable rooms.  It's nickname is &quot; Kelsey &quot;,
and it's residents are the &quot; Knights &quot;.
<dt>Qu'Appelle Hall Addition
<dd>This is the most &quot; modern &quot; of the halls.  It is the third men's house, and it's nickname is &quot;
Laverendrye &quot;.  It's rooms are tiny and built like concrete boxes.
<dt>Athabasca Hall
<dd>This hall can hold the equivalent of all three of the men's houses, and is the women's hall.  It is divided into
 three floors, whose nicknames are constatnly changing.
