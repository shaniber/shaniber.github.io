The club is the University of Saskatchewan Space Shuttle Hijacking Club 
(USSSHC).  The goals of the the club are to develop a reasonable plan to 
capture one of the USA's space shuttles, execute this hijacking, and fly 
the shuttle to a country with no extradition treaty with the USA.  
Maybe afterwards the space shuttle will be sold, but they're not really 
sure yet.  <p>

There is one meeting per month.  During the meeting there are planning and 
conspiring sessions, during which the members discuss such things as 
Hostage Situations in a Weightless Environment, Negotiating with 
President Clinton when He's Mad, Possibilities of Getting a P-lot Sticker 
for the Space Shuttle, and Foods We'd Like To See In Space.  If there is 
time at each meeting, the proper pronunciation of acronyms such as http, 
www, and others such as this.  Occasionally, a meeting will include a 
trip to Orlando, Florida to watch/hijack a shuttle launch.  <p>

Membership is open to University of Saskatchewan staff, students, and 
alumni for free, and the general public for a small membership fee.  The 
membership is comprised of people that are typically interested in seeing 
the downfall of the U.S. Space Program, people that really, really wanna 
fly in space but will never be astronauts, and people that just have 
nothing better to do.  <p>
<p>
This particular state diagram includes a typical meeting with a trip to 
Florida.  Note that as of yet, the group has not yet been able to 
successfully hijack a shuttle.<P>
