Welcome to Los Carrochos<font size=-1>,<br>a sleepy little Mexican village.  
Old men nap in front
of buildings, children play among the cactuses, buxom Mexican lasses gossip 
around the town fountain.  Sounds rather picturesque, no?  
<p>
Well, it might be, if this were any ordinary sleepy little Mexican village.
<p>
Unfortunately, this village is the hometown and haunt of...<br>
EL BEANO!
<p>

see him...]">

<p>

Look back here soon, to learn more of this folk hero, this man of the 
people, this... pinto with a crazy mustache.
