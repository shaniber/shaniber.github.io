Well, alright, it's not <strong>that</strong> big, but there might be 
something interesting here.<br>
For instance...<p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a fan of <em>cartoons</em>.  Perhaps some of the ones that you like 
will show up <a href="cartoons.html">here</a>.
<p>
<li>I like to play <em>games</em> on my computer... So I guess that I've 
got a $2500 arcade machine!  :)  Check out <a href="games.html">these sights</a> 
 for cool shareware and other neat stuff.
<p>

<li>I play Magic:the Gathering.  Click <A HREF="magic_links.html">here</A> 
for links related to the game.
<p>
</ul>
