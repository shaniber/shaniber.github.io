<H2> Or, the woes of a little psych student. </H2>
<P>

okay, so i used to be a psychology major, right?  Well, i'm not anymore.  
here's my 'i don't like psych anymore' story.<p>

so i was in Psych 321 (i think...), and we had an EXCELLENT idea for a project.
we were going to measure people's reaction to autority figures, and it was just SO neat.
well, the so-called 'board of ethics' had other ideas however... <p>

we got our proposal back from the board, and we were all excited because
it had taken SO long to get it back.  well, out professor told us that they had turned us down.  
they didn't say "change this and this", or "try fixing this", they just said:<BR>
<p align=center>"<strong>No.  You can't do this</strong>."</p><BR>
we were utterly screwed.  we had to completely resubmit the proposal.  
we didn't have time to redo the assignment, and there was no easy way to 
modify it.<p>

i didn't realize it at the time, but i was seriously CHOKED.   over the next little while,
i became more and more bitter.  i felt as if the so-called "ethics board" was not willing to risk 
ANYTHING to further the world's knowledge base.  i decided that the psychology department
didn't want any original thought, and only accepted regurgitation.<p>

now, the only reason i'm still getting the psychology degree is because i don't want to have
wasted the past 4 years of my life.  i also think that w second degree will give me a competitive
edge over the 5000 other computer science graduates from the U of S.<p>

so here's an idea George I... psych is useless.  cut it back now, before we 
all turn into pathetic wankers, who can't go a day without running for 
our therapist.<p>

before you go, i just want to qualify one thing.  there have been only two profs from psych
that i think deserve to be honored:<BR>
<DL>
<DT>Dave Scott
<DD>This man is the BEST proffesor on the face of the earth.  He is the only man who could 
make statistics easy and FUN.  I wish ALL psych profs were like him.

<DT>Art Clark
<DD>(May he rest in peace).  This professor started every class with a far side comic, and was 
very approachable and helpful.  The psych department lost alot when he passed on.
